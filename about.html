            <p>In 1940, the first “automated” conveyor-style car wash was opened in Hollywood, California. This new style of wash was “automated” in that a winch system was used to pull the car being washed through the cleaning tunnel. Workers were still present in the tunnel to soap, rinse, and dry the car.  
                In 1946, Thomas Simpson brought new technology to the car wash industry through the introduction of a semiautomatic car washing system that included a conveyor belt for moving vehicles through the wash, an overhead sprinkler for washing vehicles, and a 50 HP air blower for drying the car.</p>
