            <p> The history of commercial car washes in the United States began in 1914. People used manpower to push or move the cars through stages of the process. The name is credited to belong to Automobile Laundry in Detroit, Michigan. Frank McCormick and J.W. Hinkle opened the business in 1914.[4]
                Manual car wash operations peaked at 32 drive-through facilities in the United States. The first semi-automatic car wash in the United States made its debut in 1946</p>
